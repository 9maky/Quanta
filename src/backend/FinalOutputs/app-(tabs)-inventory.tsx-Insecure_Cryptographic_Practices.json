  "content": "## Insecure Cryptographic Practices\n\n### Description\n\nThe `InventoryContext.tsx` file uses `AsyncStorage` to store the `totalItemCount` in plaintext. This practice exposes the data to potential unauthorized access by other applications on the device, leading to a security risk.\n\n### Relevant Code Snippet\n\n```typescript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  AsyncStorage.setItem('totalItemCount', totalItemCount.toString());\n}, [totalItemCount]);\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\n- **Data Exfiltration**: Other applications on the device can access the `AsyncStorage` and read the `totalItemCount`, potentially leading to unauthorized data access.\n- **Data Tampering**: Malicious applications can modify the `totalItemCount`, leading to incorrect inventory data.\n\n### Recommended Solution\n\nTo mitigate this security risk, it is recommended to encrypt the data before storing it in `AsyncStorage`. This can be achieved using a secure encryption library such as `react-native-encrypted-storage`.\n\n#### Example Implementation\n\n1. **Install the library**:\n```bash\nnpm install react-native-encrypted-storage\n```\n\n2. **Update the code to use encrypted storage**:\n```typescript\nimport EncryptedStorage from 'react-native-encrypted-storage';\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  EncryptedStorage.setItem('totalItemCount', totalItemCount.toString());\n}, [totalItemCount]);\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy encrypting the data stored in `AsyncStorage`, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and tampering, thereby enhancing the security of your application.\n\n### File Paths\n\n- `context/InventoryContext.tsx`\n- `app/(tabs)/inventory.tsx`",
