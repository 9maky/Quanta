  "content": "## Injection Vulnerability\n\n### Description\n\nThe code constructs the base URL using a variable (`AI71_BASE_URL`), which is obtained from environment variables. If this variable is not properly sanitized, it could be manipulated to perform injection attacks.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n```python\n# backend/ai71_client.py\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nAI71_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"AI71_API_KEY\")\nAI71_BASE_URL = os.getenv(\"AI71_BASE_URL\")\n\nclass AI71Client:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.api_key = AI71_API_KEY\n        self.base_url = AI71_BASE_URL\n\n    def chat_completion(self, messages):\n        headers = {\n            \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {self.api_key}\",\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n        }\n\n        data = {\n            \"model\": \"tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat\",\n            \"messages\": messages,\n            \"stream\": True,\n            \"max_tokens\": 1280,\n            \"temperature\": 0\n        }\n\n        response = requests.post(f\"{self.base_url}chat/completions\", headers=headers, json=data, stream=True)\n\n        for line in response.iter_lines():\n            if line:\n                yield line.decode('utf-8')\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\nAn attacker could manipulate the `AI71_BASE_URL` environment variable to include malicious URLs or scripts, leading to potential injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n### Recommended Solution\n\n1. **Sanitize Input:** Ensure that the `AI71_BASE_URL` is properly sanitized and validated before use.\n2. **Use Whitelisting:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed URLs and validate the `AI71_BASE_URL` against this list.\n3. **Environment Variable Security:** Ensure that environment variables are securely managed and not exposed to unauthorized users.\n\n### Example of Sanitization\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Function to sanitize the base URL\ndef sanitize_url(url):\n    # Example: Allow only alphanumeric characters, dots, slashes, and colons\n    return re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9./:]', '', url)\n\n# Sanitize the base URL before using it\nAI71_BASE_URL = sanitize_url(os.getenv(\"AI71_BASE_URL\"))\n```\n\nBy implementing these measures, you can mitigate the risk of injection attacks and ensure the security of your application.",
