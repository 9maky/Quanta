  "content": "## Insecure Data Handling\n\n### Description\nThe application may handle sensitive data insecurely, leading to potential exposure. Sensitive data should be encrypted and properly protected during transmission and storage.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nIn the provided code, sensitive data may be transmitted or stored without proper encryption, which can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\n### Relevant Code Snippets\n\n**App.tsx:**\n```typescript\n// Example of insecure data handling\nconst handleData = (data) => {\n  // Sensitive data is not encrypted before transmission\n  fetch('https://example.com/api', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    body: JSON.stringify(data)\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept the unencrypted data during transmission.\n- **Data Breaches:** Unencrypted data stored on the server can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n1. **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** Use encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data during transmission and storage.\n2. **Use HTTPS:** Ensure that all data is transmitted over secure HTTPS connections.\n3. **Implement Secure Storage:** Use secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data, such as encrypted databases or secure vaults.\n\n### Example of Secure Data Handling\n```typescript\nimport { encryptData } from './encryptionUtils';\n\nconst handleData = (data) => {\n  const encryptedData = encryptData(data);\n  fetch('https://example.com/api', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    body: JSON.stringify(encryptedData)\n  });\n};\n```\n\nBy implementing these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of sensitive data exposure and enhance the overall security of the application.",
