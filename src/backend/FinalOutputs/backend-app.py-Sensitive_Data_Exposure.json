  "content": "# Sensitive Data Exposure\n\n## Description\nThe code prints the AI71 API key to the console using `print(f\"AI71_API_KEY: {AI71_API_KEY}\")`. This can expose the API key to anyone with access to the console logs, posing a security risk.\n\n## Vulnerable Code Snippet\n```python\nbackend/app.py:\n\nprint(\"Getting AI71 API key...\")\nAI71_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"AI71_API_KEY\")\nprint(f\"AI71_API_KEY: {AI71_API_KEY}\")\n```\n\n## Potential Attack Vectors\n- An attacker with access to the console logs can easily obtain the API key and use it to make unauthorized requests to the AI71 service.\n- This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential financial losses if the API key is used for billable services.\n\n## Recommended Solution\n- **Remove the print statement**: Avoid printing sensitive information to the console.\n- **Use logging with appropriate levels**: If logging is necessary, use a logging framework with appropriate log levels and ensure that sensitive information is not logged.\n- **Environment-specific configurations**: Ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in development or testing environments.\n\n## Secure Code Example\n```python\nbackend/app.py:\n\nprint(\"Getting AI71 API key...\")\nAI71_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"AI71_API_KEY\")\nlogger.info(\"AI71 API key retrieved successfully\")\n```\n\nBy removing the print statement and using a logging framework, you can ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in the console logs.",
