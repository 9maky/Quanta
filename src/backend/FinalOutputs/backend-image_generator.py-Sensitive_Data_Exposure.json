  "content": "## Sensitive Data Exposure\n\n### Description\n\nThe code in `backend/image_generator.py` loads the `AI71_API_KEY` from environment variables using `os.getenv` without any additional security measures. This could potentially expose the API key if not properly secured in the environment.\n\n### Relevant Code Snippet\n\n```python\n# backend/image_generator.py\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nAI71_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"AI71_API_KEY\")\nai71_client = AI71(AI71_API_KEY)\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\n- **Environment Variable Leakage**: If the environment variables are not properly secured, an attacker could gain access to the `AI71_API_KEY` and use it to make unauthorized API calls.\n- **Configuration File Exposure**: If the environment variables are stored in a configuration file that is not properly secured, an attacker could access the file and extract the API key.\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n\n1. **Environment Variable Security**: Ensure that environment variables are properly secured and not exposed to unauthorized users.\n2. **Configuration Management**: Use secure configuration management tools to store and manage sensitive information like API keys.\n3. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Use different configuration files for different environments (development, testing, production) to minimize the risk of exposure.\n4. **Access Control**: Implement strict access control measures to ensure that only authorized users and processes can access sensitive information.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Use Secret Management Tools**: Consider using secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to securely store and manage API keys.\n- **Environment Variable Encryption**: Encrypt environment variables to add an extra layer of security.\n- **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit and monitor access to sensitive information to detect and prevent unauthorized access.\n\nBy implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of sensitive data exposure and enhance the overall security of your application.",
