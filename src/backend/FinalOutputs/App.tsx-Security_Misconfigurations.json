Ensuring that the application is properly configured with secure settings is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Relevant Code Snippets\n\n**App.tsx:**\n```typescript\n// No specific code snippet provided, but the issue is related to the overall configuration of the application.\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n- **Default Credentials:** Attackers can exploit default usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access.\n- **Unnecessary Services:** Running unnecessary services can provide additional attack surfaces.\n- **Insecure Permissions:** Overly permissive file and directory permissions can lead to unauthorized access or modification.\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n- **Change Default Credentials:** Ensure that all default credentials are changed to strong, unique passwords.\n- **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable any services that are not required for the application to function.\n- **Implement Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to all users and services.\n- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any misconfigurations.\n\n### Best Practices\n- **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools to enforce secure settings across all environments.\n- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation of all configurations and settings.\n- **Automated Testing:** Implement automated testing to detect and alert on misconfigurations.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of security misconfigurations in your application.",
