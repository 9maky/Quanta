  "content": "## Insecure Data Handling\n\n### Description\n\nThe API key is included in the headers of the HTTP request, which could be intercepted if the connection is not secure. This poses a significant security risk as an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the API.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\nThe following code snippet from `backend/ai71_client.py` demonstrates the issue:\n\n```python\nload_dotenv()\n\nAI71_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"AI71_API_KEY\")\nAI71_BASE_URL = os.getenv(\"AI71_BASE_URL\")\n\nclass AI71Client:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.api_key = AI71_API_KEY\n        self.base_url = AI71_BASE_URL\n\n    def chat_completion(self, messages):\n        headers = {\n            \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {self.api_key}\",\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n        }\n\n        data = {\n            \"model\": \"tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat\",\n            \"messages\": messages,\n            \"stream\": True,\n            \"max_tokens\": 1280,\n            \"temperature\": 0\n        }\n\n        response = requests.post(f\"{self.base_url}chat/completions\", headers=headers, json=data, stream=True)\n\n        for line in response.iter_lines():\n            if line:\n                yield line.decode('utf-8')\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\n- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: An attacker could intercept the HTTP request and extract the API key from the headers.\n- **Network Sniffing**: If the connection is not encrypted, an attacker could capture the network traffic and obtain the API key.\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n\n1. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure that all API requests are made over HTTPS to encrypt the data in transit.\n2. **Environment Variables**: Store the API key securely in environment variables and avoid hardcoding it in the source code.\n3. **API Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys to minimize the impact if a key is compromised.\n4. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict API access to specific IP addresses to reduce the attack surface.\n\nBy implementing these best practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your API key handling.",
