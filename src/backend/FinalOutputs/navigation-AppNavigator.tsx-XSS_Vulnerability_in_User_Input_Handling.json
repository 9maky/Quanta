  "content": "## XSS Vulnerability in User Input Handling\n\n### Description\n\nThe application directly renders user input in the navigation component, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if malicious scripts are injected.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\nThe following code snippet from `navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\n```tsx\n// navigation/AppNavigator.tsx\n\nconst AppNavigator = ({ userInput }) => {\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <div>{userInput}</div>\n    </nav>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\nAn attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `userInput` variable, which would be executed in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.\n\n### Recommended Solution\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize and encode user input before rendering it. One way to do this in React is to use the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute with proper sanitization libraries like `DOMPurify`.\n\n```tsx\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst AppNavigator = ({ userInput }) => {\n  const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);\n  return (\n    <nav>\n      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sanitizedInput }}></div>\n    </nav>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- Always sanitize and encode user input before rendering it.\n- Use libraries like `DOMPurify` to sanitize HTML content.\n- Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization.",
