  "content": "## Sensitive Data Exposure\n\n### Description\n\nThe code in `backend/imageGenerator.py` loads the `AI71_API_KEY` from environment variables using `os.getenv` without any additional security measures. This could potentially expose the API key if not properly secured.\n\n### Relevant Code Snippet\n\n```python\n# backend/imageGenerator.py\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nAI71_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"AI71_API_KEY\")\nai71_client = AI71(AI71_API_KEY)\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\n- **Environment Variable Leakage**: If the environment variables are not properly secured, an attacker could gain access to the `AI71_API_KEY` and use it to make unauthorized API calls.\n- **Configuration File Exposure**: If the environment variables are stored in a configuration file that is not properly secured, an attacker could access the file and extract the API key.\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n\n1. **Environment Variable Security**: Ensure that environment variables are properly secured and not exposed to unauthorized users.\n2. **Configuration Management**: Use secure configuration management tools to store and manage sensitive information like API keys.\n3. **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to limit who can access and modify environment variables.\n4. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Use Secret Management Tools**: Consider using secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to securely store and manage API keys.\n- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Use environment-specific configuration files to separate sensitive data from the codebase.\n- **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit and monitor access to sensitive data to detect and prevent unauthorized access.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of sensitive data exposure and enhance the overall security of your application.",
