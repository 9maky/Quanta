  "content": "## Insecure Data Handling\n\n### Description\n\nThe `InventoryContext.tsx` file uses `AsyncStorage` to store the `totalItemCount` in plaintext. This data can be accessed by other applications on the device, which poses a risk of sensitive data exposure.\n\n### Vulnerable Code Snippet\n\n```typescript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  AsyncStorage.setItem('totalItemCount', totalItemCount.toString());\n}, [totalItemCount]);\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\n- **Data Leakage**: Other applications on the device can access the `AsyncStorage` and read the `totalItemCount`, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n- **Data Tampering**: Malicious applications can modify the `totalItemCount`, leading to incorrect inventory data.\n\n### Recommended Solution\n\nTo mitigate this issue, consider the following best practices:\n\n1. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use encryption to store sensitive data in `AsyncStorage`. Libraries like `react-native-keychain` can be used for secure storage.\n\n2. **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**: If possible, avoid storing sensitive data in `AsyncStorage`. Instead, use secure storage solutions or keep the data in memory.\n\n3. **Use Secure Storage Libraries**: Consider using libraries specifically designed for secure storage, such as `react-native-sensitive-info` or `react-native-secure-storage`.\n\n### Example of Secure Storage\n\n```typescript\nimport * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain';\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  Keychain.setGenericPassword('totalItemCount', totalItemCount.toString());\n}, [totalItemCount]);\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStoring sensitive data in plaintext using `AsyncStorage` is a security risk. By encrypting the data or using secure storage solutions, you can significantly reduce the risk of data exposure and tampering.",
