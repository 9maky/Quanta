  "content": "## Injection Vulnerabilities\n\n### Description\n\nThe application may be vulnerable to SQL or command injection attacks if user input is directly used in database queries or system commands without proper sanitization. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries or system commands, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.\n\n### Relevant Code Snippets\n\n**App.tsx:**\n\n```typescript\n// Example of vulnerable code\nconst query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\n- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can input malicious SQL code in the username or password fields to manipulate the query.\n- **Command Injection:** If user input is used in system commands, an attacker can inject malicious commands to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n\n- **Use Parameterized Queries:** Instead of directly embedding user input into queries, use parameterized queries or prepared statements.\n\n```typescript\n// Example of secure code using parameterized queries\nconst query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';\nconst params = [username, password];\n```\n\n- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it does not contain malicious code.\n\n```typescript\n// Example of input validation\nconst sanitizedUsername = sanitizeInput(username);\nconst sanitizedPassword = sanitizeInput(password);\n```\n\nBy implementing these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks in your application.",
