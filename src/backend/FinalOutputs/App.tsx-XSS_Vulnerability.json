  "content": "## XSS Vulnerability\n\n### Description\n\nThe application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of user input before rendering it on the web page. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially compromising user data and the integrity of the application.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n**App.tsx:**\n\n```tsx\nconst App = () => {\n  const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={userInput} onChange={(e) => setUserInput(e.target.value)} />\n      <div>{userInput}</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into the input field. For example, an attacker could input `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would be executed when the page is rendered.\n\n### Recommended Solution\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize user input before rendering it on the web page. One way to do this in a React application is to use libraries like `DOMPurify` to sanitize the input.\n\n**Updated App.tsx:**\n\n```tsx\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');\n\n  const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={userInput} onChange={(e) => setUserInput(e.target.value)} />\n      <div>{sanitizedInput}</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nBy sanitizing the user input, you can prevent malicious scripts from being executed, thereby protecting the application and its users from XSS attacks.",
