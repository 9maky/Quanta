  "content": "## Insecure Cryptographic Practices\n\n### Description\nThe application may use weak cryptographic algorithms or improper key management practices, leading to potential data breaches. This can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.\n\n### Relevant Code Snippets\n\n**App.tsx:**\n```typescript\n// Example of weak cryptographic practice\nconst encryptData = (data: string) => {\n    const key = 'weak-key'; // Hardcoded key\n    const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, key).toString();\n    return encrypted;\n};\n```\n\n### Potential Attack Vectors\n1. **Weak Algorithms:** Using weak cryptographic algorithms can make it easier for attackers to decrypt sensitive data.\n2. **Hardcoded Keys:** Hardcoding cryptographic keys in the source code can lead to key exposure if the code is compromised.\n3. **Improper Key Management:** Poor key management practices, such as reusing keys or not rotating them regularly, can increase the risk of key compromise.\n\n### Recommended Solutions\n1. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms:** Ensure that the application uses strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256 for encryption.\n2. **Avoid Hardcoding Keys:** Store cryptographic keys securely, using environment variables or secure key management services.\n3. **Implement Proper Key Management:** Regularly rotate keys and use unique keys for different purposes to minimize the risk of key compromise.\n\n### Example of Secure Practice\n```typescript\n// Example of secure cryptographic practice\nconst encryptData = (data: string) => {\n    const key = process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY; // Key stored in environment variable\n    const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, key).toString();\n    return encrypted;\n};\n```\n\nBy following these best practices, the application can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches due to insecure cryptographic practices.",
