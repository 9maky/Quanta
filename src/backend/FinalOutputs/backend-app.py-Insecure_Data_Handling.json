  "content": "# Insecure Data Handling\n\n## Description\n\nThe CORS policy in the Flask application is configured to allow all origins, which can expose the application to cross-origin attacks. This configuration allows any domain to make requests to the API, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\n## Vulnerable Code\n\n```python\n# backend/app.py\n\nprint(\"Loading environment variables...\")\nload_dotenv()\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nprint(\"Initializing Flask app...\")\napp = Flask(__name__)\nCORS(app, resources={r\"/*\": {\"origins\": \"*\"}})\n```\n\n## Potential Attack Vectors\n\n- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Attacks**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make unauthorized requests to the API from a malicious website, potentially stealing sensitive data or performing actions on behalf of the user.\n\n## Recommended Solution\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is essential to restrict the CORS policy to allow only trusted origins. This can be done by specifying a list of allowed origins in the CORS configuration.\n\n```python\n# backend/app.py\n\nprint(\"Loading environment variables...\")\nload_dotenv()\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\nprint(\"Initializing Flask app...\")\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Restrict CORS to trusted origins\nCORS(app, resources={r\"/*\": {\"origins\": [\"https://trusted-origin1.com\", \"https://trusted-origin2.com\"]}})\n```\n\nBy restricting the CORS policy to trusted origins, you can significantly reduce the risk of cross-origin attacks and enhance the security of your application.",
