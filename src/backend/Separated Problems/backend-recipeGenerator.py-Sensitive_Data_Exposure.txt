Title of the problem is: Sensitive Data Exposure. Here is the description of the problem: The AI71_API_KEY is loaded from environment variables using os.getenv without any additional security measures. This could potentially expose the API key if not properly secured in the environment.
And here are the codes where this problem is appearing:
backend/recipeGenerator.py:

load_dotenv()

AI71_API_KEY = os.getenv("AI71_API_KEY")
ai71_client = AI71(AI71_API_KEY)

def generate_recipe2(recipe_idea, diet_type, skill_level):
    prompt = (
        f"Your task is to generate a recipe using the provided user input and format it according to the given JSON structure. "
        f"User wants to get a recipe for {recipe_idea}. Using user's input, generate a recipe that includes all the necessary components. "
        f"Here is diet type that user choosed: {diet_type}, and here is skill level that user choosed: {skill_level}."
        f"Follow these guidelines: 1. Create a recipe title that reflects the main ingredients or cooking method. "
        f"2. Write a brief description of the dish. 3. Estimate the cooking time in minutes. 4. Provide an approximate calorie count per serving. "
        f"5. Assign a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard). 6. List the ingredients, including quantities and units where appropriate. "
        f"Use the user's preferred weight and liquid units. For each ingredient, randomly assign \"available\" as true or false. "
        f"7. Create a list of directions, with each step numbered and including a brief title and detailed instructions. "
        f"Use the user's preferred temperature unit in the instructions. "
        f"8. Ensure the recipe does not include any ingredients the user is allergic to. "
        f"9. You MUST create 5 - 15 directions for the recipe. "
        f"Format your output as a JSON object with the following structure: {{ \"recipes\": [ {{ \"title\": \"Recipe Title\", \"description\": \"Short 8 words description of the dish\", "
        f"\"long_description\": \"Long and detailed description of the dish\", \"time\": \"Estimated time in minutes\", \"calories\": Estimated calories per serving, "
